Citrus: Continuous Integration Testing running until sunrise.

Citrus is a simple continuous integration testing framework that can be
configured with scripts.

The basis of citrus is **running 5 phases for each batch**:

- Setup
- Start
- Test
- Stop
- Hooks

Each phase will execute the corresponding scripts, which can be defined
globally and per repository.

## Configuration

Each script will run through a prelude script that allows you to specify global
variables that will be available for all the scripts.

There can be any number of `setup`, `start`, `test`, `stop` and `hook` scripts.
The filename of each script must start with the name of the phase in lower
case.

The scripts for each phase will be sorted in alphabetical order; this allows
defining which scripts will run first.  This sorting is applied to the complete
set of all phase scripts (global and repository scripts together).  For
example, if a tests has two parts (send and recive) and you want to ensure that
send is run before receive, name them like this: `test_00_send` and
`test_01_recive`

All the scripts must be executable (`chmod +x script`).

All the scripts will go to the configuration folder, where the top level
contains global scripts, and each folder with a repository names contains the
scripts that will run for that repository.

The configuration folder also contains a configuration file (`config.toml`)
where you specify the list of repository urls, and further parameters like
timeouts in seconds.

See the `example` folder for a specific example.
